# XLS to XLSX Converter

This C# console application automates the conversion of legacy `.xls` files to the modern `.xlsx` format using the **Spire.XLS** library. It processes all `.xls` files found in subdirectories of a specified root folder and exports the converted files to a mirrored folder structure.
